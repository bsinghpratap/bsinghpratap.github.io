                            I am a MS-PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">College of Informatics and Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts - Amherst</a>. I work at the <a href="http://bio-nlp.org/">BioNLP lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/hong_yu">Prof. Hong Yu</a>. I've also had the opportunity to work with some awesome people from <a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/">MIT-IBM Watson Lab</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon Alexa-AI team</a>.
                            Before joining UMass in 2017, I worked as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www2.shl.com/en/india/">Aspiring Minds (now SHL)</a>. I completed my undergraduate from <a href="http://mnit.ac.in/">MNIT, Jaipur</a>.

                            My research aims at developing tools and methods to automate and alleviate the current state of clinical decision support systems. I have worked on projects related to clinical question answering, document-level prediction, domain adaptation and clinical privacy. In recent years, I have worked on multiple projects in collaboration with <a href="https://www.va.gov/bedford-health-care/">Department of Veteran Affairs - Bedford</a> to understand the associations between Veteran's medical and socio-economic conditions and their mental and physical health.

                                        Suicide is an important public health concern and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Suicidal behaviors, including suicide attempts (SA) and suicide ideations (SI), are leading risk factors for death by suicide. Information related to patients' previous and current SA and SI are frequently documented in the electronic health record (EHR) notes. Accurate detection of such documentation may help improve surveillance and predictions of patients' suicidal behaviors and alert medical professionals for suicide prevention efforts. In this work, we first built
<b>S</b>ui<b>c</b>ide <b>A</b>ttempt and Ideatio<b>N</b> Events (ScAN) dataset, a subset of the publicly available MIMIC III dataset spanning over 12k+ EHR notes with 19k+ annotated SA and SI events information. The annotations also contain attributes such as method of suicide attempt. We also built a strong baseline model ScANER, a multi-task RoBERTa-based model with a retrieval module to extract all the relevant suicidal behavioral evidences from EHR notes of an hospital-stay and, and a prediction module to identify the type of suicidal behavior (SA and SI) concluded during the patient's stay at the hospital.

Using administrative data from the United States (US) Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we studied associations between TBI and PTSD diagnoses, and hospitalizations due to intentional self-harm, among US Veterans who used VHA healthcare.

                                    Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) incorporates SDOH concepts; but few have evaluated its coverage and quality. With 15,649 expert-annotated SDOH mentions from 3176 randomly selected electronic health record (EHR) notes, we found that 100% SDOH mentions can be mapped to at least one UMLS concept, indicating a good coverage of SDOH. However, we discovered a few challenges for the UMLS's representation of SDOH. Next, we developed a multi-step framework to identify SDOH concepts from UMLS, and a clinical BERT-based classification algorithm to assign each identified SDOH concept to one of the six general categories. Our multi-step framework extracted a total of 198,677 SDOH concepts from the UMLS and the SDOH category classification system attained an accuracy of 91%. We also built EASE: an open-source tool to Extract SDOH from EHRs.

                                        In this work we focused towards identifying causality between a medication and its adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using a clinically standardized assessment technique called Naranjo scale. Naranjo scale provides a list of ten questions that are answered against patients' notes to assess drug-ADR causality assessment. We developed a multi-task learning framework that would take a question from Naranjo scale along with a patient's note to identify relevant evidence sentences and paragraphs in the note while also predicting the answer. Such automated causality assessments are essential for pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance and would reduce the necessary manpower required for manual chart reviews.

                                        <b>[5.] Entity-Enriched Neural Models for Clinical Question Answering.</b>

                                        We explore state-of-the-art neural models for question answering on electronic medical records and improve their ability to generalize better on previously unseen (paraphrased) questions at test time. We enable this by learn- ing to predict logical forms as an auxiliary task along with the main task of answer span detection. The predicted logical forms also serve as a rationale for the answer. Further, we also incorporate medical entity information in these models via the ERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019a) architecture. We train our models on the large-scale emrQA dataset and observe that our multi-task entity-enriched models generalize to paraphrased questions ∼5% better than the baseline BERT model.
