    Working on building an effective question answering model for extracting the causal relationship between a medication and its ADRs. We are mainly focusing on anti-coagulants and bleeding events.

    - Papers accepted at <mark>KDD'19 and MLHC'19</mark>.
    - Organized a [Workshop](https://github.com/bsinghpratap/AMIA_2019_tutorial) on Multi-task Deep Learning for Clinical Judgement Studies at AMIA'19.

    Developing variants of sequence models which can handle missing, multi-resolution and irregularly sampled temporal data.

    - The architecture creates informative representation rather than imputing values for each feature at different time-steps.
    - It models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals for building informative representations.

    Worked on an independent project which focussed on building a toolbox which could build bagged ensembles with the help of Genetic Algorithm.

    - We tried multiple fitness functions to assess ensembles and empirically compare our performance against randomized sampling of training data and feature subspaces.
    - Paper accepted at <mark>DEML, ICML'16</mark>.
